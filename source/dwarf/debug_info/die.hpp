    /// @details DWARF uses a series of debugging information entries (DIEs) to define a
    ///     low-level representation of a source program. Each debugging information entry
    ///     consists of an identifying tag and a series of attributes. An entry, or group of
    ///     entries together, provide a description of a corresponding entity in the source
    ///     program. The tag specifies the class to which an entry belongs and the attributes
    ///     define the specific characteristics of the entry.
